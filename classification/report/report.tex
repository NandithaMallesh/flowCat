\section{SOM Generation setup}

Result analysis have been done for the included cohort using the following settings in SOM-Generation:

\begin{description}
   \item[normal] SOM generated using 5 cases from each cohort, without any further modification of the data
   \item[pregated] Pregating of each individual SOM on negative side-scatter and positive CD45, which roughly translates to the lymphocyte population
\end{description}

Some additional modifications of the dataset for the consensus SOM generation can be applied in both approaches.

\begin{description}
   \item[exc] Exclusion of the normal cohort in the reference SOM generation
   \item[selected] Cases for reference SOM are preselected instead of randomly chosen from each cohort
\end{description}

This yields us 4 different configurations for the initial consensus SOM generation and followed upsampling.

Additionally some additional SOM processing methods have been tested in another selection of setups.

\begin{description}
   \item[som] Consensus SOM created using SOM nodes instead of raw data.
   \item[somgated] Consensus SOM created using SOM nodes after pregating.
   \item[som\_combined] SOM nodes will be used for combined gating.
   \item[pregated\_combined] Pregating for consensus SOM batched for all input cases.
   \item[always\_som] SOM nodes for both consensus SOM and also upsampling of individual samples.
\end{description}

After our initial AWS Batch runs of the consensus SOM samples, we have obtained the following number of upsampled data.

\end{figure}

Two sets of experiments have been generated so far, with \emph{initial\_comp} containing the first set of experiments and \emph{comp\_pregating}, containing additional experiments with other SOM-generation settings.


\section{Classification setup}

Each setup is classified independently and afterwards identical replications are averaged to provide the average classification
accuracy over multiple consensus SOM generations.

In classification there are also multiple parameters, which we can vary, of which the most important are:

\begin{description}
   \item[groups] Diagnoses to be classified, which can also be grouped into new meta-classes, that count as one
   \item[number] Maximum number of cases classified for each group. Alternatively all classes can be reduced to the lowest one.
\end{description}

The random component in the classifier is constrained to the initialization of the neural network weights and the choice of cases in the train and test datasets.

\begin{description}
   \item[initial\_comp] Comparisons between LMg (LPL, Marginal), MtCp (Mantle, CLL/PL), CM (CLL, MBL) and normal with maximum group size of 2000.
\end{description}

This setup is applied to all experiments described in the SOM setup section.
